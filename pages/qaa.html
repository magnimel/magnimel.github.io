                            I made this portfolio website while completing Havardx CS50’s Introduction to Computer
                            Science.
                            I started the course because I wanted to be a little ahead when I start my CS degree at the
                            University of British Columbia.
                            CS50 is a demanding yet fantastic course that helps me further my proficiency and
                            understanding of computer science and programming.
                            I want to say thank you to the CS50 staff and Havardx for amazingly delivering such
                            a high-quality and enjoyable course.
                            This website was only supposed to be a simple assignment. But why build a house, when you
                            can build a castle ? ... right ?
                            <br><br>
                            I also want to say a big thank you to Tina Huang. She is an amazing person, and I can
                            confidently say that she has been the most influential person in
                            my life over this past year. It is also thanks to her that I got the idea of making a
                            portfolio website.
                            Of course, she does not know me... Be sure to check out her <a

                            I am from the Ivory Coast <span>🇨🇮</span> , which is located in west Africa. French is the
                            most spoken language in Ivory Coast.
                            The Ivory Coast has a warm and humid climate. From equatorial on the southern shores to
                            tropical in the center and semiarid in the far north, we have it all.
                            The Ivory Coast is well-known as the world's largest supplier of cocoa beans (45%), which
                            are used in the production of chocolate. Didier Drogba, currently retired,
                            is most likely Ivory Coast's most popular figure. He was hailed as one of the best players
                            from his time at Chelsea and with the Ivory Coast national team. He also recently hosted the
                            Golden Ball gala.

                            I first earned a degree in chemical engineering in the United Kingdom. Throughout my
                            studies, I got involved with the design, production,
                            and manufacturing of a wide range of products through industrial processes. Yet, I've always
                            been more interested in technology and computers
                            than anything else. I became increasingly interested in computer science and artificial
                            intelligence applications to chemical engineering and industrial systems.
                            Throughout my degree, I participated in a variety of academic activities relevant to this
                            theme. Through studying computer science,
                            I am interested in developing computer software and artificial intelligence that will
                            optimize the operation and management of businesses and digital products,
                            as well as improve the productivity, safety, and sustainability of industrial processes.

                            For someone like me who tend to keep everything because: "hmm... we never know ?", it was
                            difficult.
                            So I got an iPad + Pencil. Now I keep all my books in the Books app and take notes using the
                            GoodNotes app. Everything is
                            backed up in Cloud, so I don't risk losing anything.

                            I had the opportunity to learn about patience and allow for time and effort to lead me to
                            success.

                            In summer 2019, I traveled to Japan to observe Japan's technological expertise and
                            advancement in robotics. 
                            Japan has always been a leading nation in industrial robotics. I visited the National Museum
                            of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan), 
                            well-known for its exhibitions on robotics technologies. The most exciting part of the trip
                            was the culture and the food. 
                            I enjoy spending most of my time in Akihabara Electric Town and trying new food. I even
                            learned some Japanese dishes to enjoy at home.
